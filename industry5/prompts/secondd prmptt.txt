so this is important please listen carefully so we are creating a business analytics dashboard with a illama 3 8b. 
now i will explain the user journey so a user enter the web and adds all the business credentials and save it and it will automatically compute attributes such as cm1 ,cm2 etc i will give you the specify attributes and math later .now when we compute the values with the kpis and we will show graphs fro cm1 and others that i will tell later okay and now in every attribute there will be a option for entering the values and one buttton will be there called ai analytics or we can call it ai analisys so for example i am i have entered a value for selling price and press compute so new values are updated like cm1 ,sales etc and when the user clicks the ai analysis button  we will give our offline illama 3 8 b all the data of the business like all the attributes and but we specifies the value in which the user clicks the ai analysis and tells the ai to give me a analysis  for eg if the user clicked the cm1 's ai analysis button the we will give all the data to the ai model but we will say like how it affects the cm1 did you understand we will first build this much and we will include the maths logic in backend and we may modify the idea also but for now this our idea\
